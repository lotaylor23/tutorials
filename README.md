# Tutorial VT1: Multiomics Data Integration using Graph Based Machine Learning

## Overview:

In recent years, the field of systems biology has made significant strides, driven by the explosion of multiomics data. Genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics provide complementary insights into the molecular underpinnings of biology, but analyzing these data sets in isolation often limits our ability to uncover complex biological relationships. The true potential of multiomics lies in integrating these diverse data layers to create a holistic understanding of cellular and organismal processes.

However, integrating and analyzing multiomics data is no small task. The sheer volume, complexity, and heterogeneity of these datasets present unique challenges that require sophisticated computational approaches. In this session, we will delve into some of the most powerful techniques for tackling these challenges, including Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), machine learning, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). These methods allow us to uncover hidden patterns and relationships across biological layers, which can lead to insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and the identification of novel biomarkers.

By applying these advanced tools to real-world multiomics datasets, this tutorial will not only enhance your computational skills but also provide a deeper understanding of how these techniques can be used to drive biological discoveries and improve clinical outcomes.

This repository provides a tutorial to introduce participants to the integration of multiomics data from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, focusing on computational approaches to uncover hidden relationships between biological entities. It will cover techniques such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), machine learning, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model multi-layered biological interactions and predict biological outcomes such as disease classification, drug responses, and biomarker discovery. Attendees will gain hands-on experience in processing and analyzing real-world multiomics datasets using open-source tools such as Python, pandas, scikit-learn.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, attendees will be able to:

Understand key computational approaches for integrating and analyzing multiomics data, including NMF, machine learning, and GNNs.
Apply open-source tools to implement predictive models for disease classification, biomarker identification, and drug response analysis.
Evaluate model performance and interpret results to derive meaningful biological insights.

## Intended Audience and Level
This tutorial is designed for intermediate to advanced learners with an interest in multiomics data integration and its applications in machine learning. It is ideal for bioinformaticians, computational biologists, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners who want to expand their knowledge of graph-based methods in multiomics analysis.

The tutorial is targeted at professionals, researchers, and graduate students with at least a basic understanding of:

Omics Data (Genomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics)
Machine Learning, especially Neural Networks
Programming (Python, familiarity with ML libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow)

## There are three code notebooks that will be used in this tutorial. Using these code notebooks we will cover:
1.	Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
2.	Using NMF for Biomarker Discovery
3.	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
