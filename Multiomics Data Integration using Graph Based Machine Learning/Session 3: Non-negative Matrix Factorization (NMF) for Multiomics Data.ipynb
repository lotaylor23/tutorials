    "### Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):\n",
    "\n",
    "NMF is a matrix factorization technique that helps uncover hidden patterns in complex datasets by decomposing data into non-negative components. NMF decomposes a non-negative matrix into two non-negative matrices‚Äîone representing the relationship between samples and the latent components, and the other representing the relationship between the latent components and the original features.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is particularly useful in multiomics, where it can identify latent factors that represent biological processes shared across different layers of omic data. By applying NMF, we can reduce the dimensionality of multi-omics data, making it easier to analyze and visualize complex biological relationships. In the context of multiomics data, NMF can uncover shared patterns across different omics layers, reducing the complexity of the data and enabling further analysis such as clustering, classification, and feature extraction.\n",

    "### Key Characteristics of NMF:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Unsupervised Learning:** NMF is unsupervised because it doesn't require labeled data. It seeks to find hidden patterns or structures in the data based on the data's intrinsic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Factorization:** NMF works by factorizing a non-negative matrix ùëâ into two smaller non-negative matrices ùëä and ùêª, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "                        ùëâ ‚âà ùëä √ó ùêª\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ùëâ is the original data matrix (for example, gene expression values or document-term matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ùëä contains the \"basis\" or \"components,\" often interpreted as the features or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ùêª contains the \"coefficients\" or \"activations,\" showing how strongly each component is present in the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Non-Negativity Constraint:** The key feature of NMF is that it enforces non-negative values in the factorization. This is useful in biological data or image processing, where negative values may not make sense or may not have an interpretable meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Dimensionality Reduction:** NMF is often used for reducing the dimensionality of the data while maintaining interpretability. The lower-dimensional representations (in ùëä and ùêª) can reveal latent patterns or clusters in the data.\n"

    "+ Gene Expression Data: NMF is commonly used to uncover hidden patterns in gene expression data, identifying gene signatures or latent biological processes.\n",

    "+ Text Mining: In natural language processing, NMF can be applied to decompose document-term matrices to uncover topics (similar to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA).\n",

    "+ Image Processing: NMF is also used for image compression and feature extraction, where the matrix could represent pixel intensities.\n",
